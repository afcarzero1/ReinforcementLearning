# Reinforcement Learning

This repository puts together different reinforcement learning projects done under a 
university course

## MazeMDP

Modeling of a Maze problem as a Markov Decision Process and solution using classical dynamic programming
and value iteration.

## MountainCar

Shows how to train an agent in the Gym environment *Mountain cart* using a **SARSA**
algorithm trained using stochastic gradient descent with Nesterov acceleration and using
as function approximation for the value function a linear regressor with Fourier basis.

A detailed analysis of the results can be found under the docs folder.

## Deep Architectures

Here it is possible to find an implementation similar to RLLib for training and testing Reinforcement Learning methods
in a versatile way. It shows how to implement DDPG and DQN under this framework to solve tasks in a Gym environment.
